## Rules of the game

The goal of the game is to say the same word at the same time.

In each round, the two players say a word outloud.  They may not say a
word that either player has said previously.  Ideally, the word that
they say is "related" (somehow!) to the previous pair of words said.
In this way, the players are saying words which move closer to each
other, until they finally say the same word at the same time.
